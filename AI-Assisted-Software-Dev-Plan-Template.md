# AI-Assisted Software Development Plan Template

## Project Overview
**Description:**
*(Briefly describe the product or feature. What is its purpose? Who will use it? What problem does it solve?)*

## Objectives
*(List the main goals for this implementation. What are we trying to achieve?)*
* **Objective 1:** *(e.g., Implement [Feature X] that allows users to [do something])*
* **Objective 2:** *(e.g., Ensure performance is optimized to handle [X] concurrent users)*
* **Objective 3:** *(Optional: Any other key success criteria?)*

## Scope & Constraints
* **In-Scope:** *(What features, components, or tasks are included?)*
* **Out-of-Scope:** *(What is explicitly **not** included in this project?)*
* **Constraints:** *(Technical limitations, coding guidelines, deadlines, or other restrictions?)*

## Architecture & Design Considerations
* **High-Level Design:** *(Describe how the feature/product fits into the system. What are the key components?)*
* **Technology Stack:** *(What languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools should be used?)*
* **Design Principles & Patterns:** *(Any architectural patterns to follow? MVC, microservices, etc.?)*
* **AI Role:** *(How will AI be used? Generating code, reviewing, testing?)*
* **Security & Performance Considerations:** *(Any security concerns, scalability, or optimization needs?)*

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: [Name of First Phase]
* [Step 1]
* [Step 2]
* [Step 3]
* [Additional steps as needed]

### Phase 2: [Name of Second Phase]
* [Step 1]
* [Step 2]
* [Step 3]
* [Additional steps as needed]

### Phase 3: [Name of Third Phase]
* [Step 1]
* [Step 2]
* [Step 3]
* [Additional steps as needed]

*(Add or remove phases as appropriate for your project)*

## Testing & Validation
* **Unit Tests:** *(Define what should be tested at the function/module level)*
* **Integration Tests:** *(How will we test the interaction between components?)*
* **Code Review Process:** *(How will we verify AI-generated code meets standards?)*
* **Performance & Security Checks:** *(Any specific performance benchmarks or security concerns?)*

## Deployment Strategy (optional)
* **Environment:** *(Will this go to staging, production, etc.?)*
* **Deployment Process:** *(CI/CD pipelines, manual deployment steps, etc.?)*
* **Monitoring & Rollback Plan:** *(How will we track issues post-deployment? What's the rollback plan?)*

## Iteration & Feedback Loop
* **Iteration Plan:** *(How will we adjust the plan if needed?)*
* **Feedback Collection:** *(Who provides feedback? What tools will we use to track it?)*
* **Adjustments & Next Steps:** *(What happens after this iteration is complete?)*

## Next Actions for AI
*(Instructions for AI in the next chat session. This entire document will be provided to each new chat to maintain context.)*

**Current Status:** *(Summary of what has been completed so far)*

**Next Tasks:** *(Specific tasks for AI to focus on in this session)*
* [Task 1]
* [Task 2]
* [Optional: Task 3]

**Specific Instructions:** *(Any detailed guidance, considerations, or requirements for the upcoming tasks)*

**Expected Output:** *(What deliverables AI should produce in this session)*
